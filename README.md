# Development machine setup
#### General notes on setting up my development environment's in various operating systems. Typical setups are for a combination of C++, Node / JavaScript & Python.
*NB: these are general notes I use when switching between machines/setting up new machines, probably of no use to anyone but me*

- Default editors
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on most systems, particularly for JavaScript/Python work
    - [Settings file](./settings.json)
  - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) on older Linux distro's that can't run code
  - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) on Windows for C++ etc
  - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on macOS for C++ etc
- Git:
  - [Readable note](./git-setup.md)
  - [Config file](./.gitconfig)
- [Linux setup](./linux.md)
- [Windows tools](./windows.md)
